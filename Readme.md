## Opal Homework

The project: create a drive-thru ordering system.
The scope of this can get out of hand very quickly, so please don't feel the need to implement a fully functioning system that persists data. For now, keeping everything in memory will suffice; unless of course you want to go the extra mile. That's all up to you. Also, don't worry too much about the way it looks. We'll be looking at the javascript, html, and css files together. This project should take about 8-10 hours at most, so please plan your time accordingly, and don't worry if you can't get done everything you might want to.

##### The requirements for the project:
1. Create a visual menu where the drive-thru employee can select menu items to build the order and then send the order to the cooks.
2. Handle a case where someone has decided to change their order once they get to the window.
3. Handle a case where someone has decided to cancel an order once they get to the window.
4. Have a way to view current open orders and then close them when they're handed to our happy customers.
5. Alert the manager when the total number of open orders goes above 4.
6. Include a suite of tests for your code.

Ideally this would be built in React and Redux, but as with anything else, use the best tool for the job at hand.

To get started, simply clone or fork this repo and start committing.

Thanks a lot, and please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. We can't wait to see what you produce.
